<p>The Prophet ﷺ said: “Seeking knowledge is mandatory upon each Muslim.” (Ibn Mājah 224)</p>
<p>The Scholars have explained that the mandatory knowledge every Muslim is responsible for learning, are five topics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Beliefs: This refers to the knowledge and conviction regarding what is obligatory from the attributes of Allah Almighty, what is impossible and what is possible; and the same for the attributes of the Prophets (blessings and peace upon them all). Also, knowing and believing in what has been Narrated, such as the Gathering [al-Ḥashr], The Resurrection [al-Nashr], The Path to Paradise [al-Ṣirāt], etc. The Short Text Aqīda Ahl al-Sunnah by Shaykh al-Hāshīmī (Allah have mercy upon him) fulfills this requirement, or the Short Text Umm al-Barāhīn (also known as al-Ṣughrā).</p></li>
<li><p>Correct Recitation [Tajwīd]: This is accomplished by correcting Quran recitation. The bare minimum is correcting the recitation of Surah al-Fatiha and what is read in Ritual Prayer [Ṣalāh / Namāz].</p></li>
<li><p>The Fiqh of Worship: The rules of Purification, Ritual Prayer, and Fasting. Also, the rules of Zakah and Hajj for whom it’s mandatory. The Short Text Nūr al-Īdāḥ for Hanafis fulfills this requirement, or its equivalent in the other Schools of Fiqh [Madhhab].</p></li>
<li><p>The Fiqh of Transactions: Transactions are in two types:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The rules of buying and selling</li>
<li>The rules of personal status (like marriage and divorce) The Short Text al-Qudūrī for Hanafis fulfills this requirement, or its equivalent in the other Schools of Fiqh.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Purification of the Soul [Tazkiyah]: The bare minimum is to be free of the major sins, both internal and external. Perusing the following fulfills this requirement:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The book, al-Zawājir ʿan Iqtirāf al-Kabāʾir [Restrictions Against Committing Major Sins] by Imam Ibn Ḥajar al-Haytamī</li>
<li>The two books: Tuḥfat al-Sālikīn (a summary of Iḥyā ʿUlūm al-Dīn), along with al-Fuyūḍ al-Aḥmadiyyah (a summary of Al-ʿUhūd al-Muḥammadiyyah)</li>
</ol></li>
